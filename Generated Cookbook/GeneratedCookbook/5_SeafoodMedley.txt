from the quote "The sun shines all day, and the clouds are ever so juttingly up to the sea. 
Then, at last, they come" to create a seafood medley that's bursting with flavor and perfect for enjoying on 
a sunny day by the sea.

To make this dish, you'll need the following ingredients:

1 lb. fresh mussels
1 lb. fresh clams
1 lb. fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 lb. calamari, sliced into rings
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup olive oil
1 lemon, juiced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper, to taste
Crusty bread, for serving


Begin by cleaning the mussels and clams. Rinse them thoroughly under cold running water, and discard 
any that are open or don't close when you tap them lightly. Set the mussels and clams aside.

Next, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut√© for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. 
Add the shrimp and calamari to the skillet, and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and the 
calamari is cooked through.

Add the mussels and clams to the skillet, and pour in the white wine. Cover the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes, until 
the mussels and clams have opened. Discard any that remain closed. Add the lemon juice and chopped parsley to the 
skillet, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve the seafood medley hot, with crusty bread for soaking up the flavorful broth. This dish is perfect for a 
sunny day by the sea, as you can savor the fresh, salty flavors of the ocean while enjoying the warmth of the sun
