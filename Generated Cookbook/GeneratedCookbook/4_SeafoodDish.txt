"Sunday afternoon, and he looked on wistfully at the picturesque little island of Bexleyeslake. She is beautiful."

On a lazy Sunday afternoon, there's nothing quite like taking a stroll by a beautiful body of water. 
Whether it's a river, a lake, or an ocean, the calming sound of the waves and the sight of the water stretching 
out as far as the eye can see can be incredibly soothing. And when the water is surrounded by beautiful scenery, like 
the picturesque little island of Bexleyeslake, the effect is even more magical.

This recipe is inspired by the beauty of Bexleyeslake, and the way it seems to capture the peace and tranquility 
of a lazy Sunday afternoon. We're going to make a seafood dish that's as beautiful and calming as the lake itself, 
using fresh, sustainable ingredients that capture the essence of the sea.

Ingredients:

1 lb wild-caught shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 lb wild-caught scallops
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced yellow bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
Lemon wedges, for serving


Instructions:

Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 

Add the red onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until soft and translucent.

Add the diced red and yellow bell peppers to the skillet, and sauté for another 2-3 minutes, until the peppers are tender.

Add the minced garlic to the skillet, and sauté for 30 seconds, until fragrant.

Add the shrimp to the skillet, and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until they turn pink and are cooked through.

Add the scallops to the skillet, and sauté for another 2-3 minutes, until they're opaque and cooked through.

Sprinkle the smoked paprika over the seafood, and toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Top the seafood with the chopped parsley and cilantro, and give everything a final toss.

Serve the seafood hot, with lemon wedges on the side.


This seafood dish is a celebration of the sea, with its fresh, sustainable ingredients and bold, smoky flavors. 
The combination of shrimp and scallops is perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon, when you want something light 
and refreshing, but also satisfying. The diced red and yellow bell peppers bring a burst of sweetness and color 
to the dish, while the red onion adds a mellow, savory note. And the smoked paprika ties everything together with its 
rich, earthy flavor.

As you eat this dish, imagine the beauty of Bexleyeslake, and the way it seems to capture the peace and tranquility 
of a lazy Sunday afternoon. Picture the water stretching out as far as the eye can see, and the little island at the 
center of it all, surrounded by trees and rocks and other beautiful scenery. And know that in this seafood dish,
