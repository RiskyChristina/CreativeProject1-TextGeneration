In conclusion, there were some problems that I ran into when using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. I wanted to curate 
a 3,000-word response from one prompt. No matter how I would word the prompt I was only ever given 
about 600 words at a given time. The AI looked as if it was going to generate more text, but would always 
stop in the middle of the sentence once a 600ish word limit was reached. Sometimes it would end around 
588 words in the middle of the sentence, sometimes it would go a bit higher, but never hitting the 3,000 limit I asked for. 

To hit the 3,000 words I wanted, I had to ask multiple prompts. With all the quotes I picked out and used 
from the first generative text model, I ended up with seven different recipes and a total word count of 3,351. 
Overall, the stories created along with the recipes where interesting to read and related to the quote in 
some way. The most interesting thing to come about this was I was randomly generated a drink, and appetizer, 
some main courses, and a dessert in which it basically created it’s own cook book even though the prompts were 
asked separately each time.
