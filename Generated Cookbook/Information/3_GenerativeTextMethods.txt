I used a Google Colab for the first generative text method called Train a GPT-2 Text Generating Model w/ GPU.

Here's the link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce

I followed along the given steps and synced my Google Docs to the file. When it came to the actual generation, 
I modified the values that were given.

For the first run on the training, the values I used were:

dataset=file_name,
              model_name='124M',
              learning_rate=1e-5,
              steps=50,
              restore_from='fresh',
              run_name='run1',
              print_every=5,
              sample_every=10,
              save_every=500


As for the second run, I used these values and retrained the model four more times after:

dataset=file_name,
              model_name='124M',
              learning_rate=1e-5,
              steps=200,
              restore_from='latest',
              run_name='run1',
              print_every=20,
              sample_every=100,
              save_every=500
              )


After the training was done, I reloaded my checkpoint and began generating text from my trained model. 
The values I used for the generative code was:

gpt2.generate(sess,
              length=25,
              temperature=0.7,
              prefix="Love is",
              nsamples=5,
              batch_size=5
              )

I wanted to curate five samples with a max character limit of 25. Also, I wanted the quotes to be 
short as to hopefully not confuse the next generative text model I would be using. Here are the quotes 
I decided to keep, with my prefix I choose placed in brackets.

    1. [Sunday afternoon], and he looked on wistfully at the picturesque little island of Bexleyeslake.
       She is beautiful
    2. [A walk on the beach] is not a holiday!
       Yes, life is few and far between, eh?
       But they is pleasant,

After I got the number of quotes I wanted, I shifted over to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. 

Here's the link: https://openai.com/

I asked the AI if it was possible for it to write 3,000 because that is the amount, I wanted from it. 
It said that it could so I proceeded to ask it a variety of prompts to get the responses I wanted to see. 
The prompt I settled on was “can you create a blog style recipe that has 3,000 words, inspired by the quote, [enter quote here]”.
